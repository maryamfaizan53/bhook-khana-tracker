Below is a representation of how this application would implement subscription plans using Python OOP.

{`# Python OOP Principles (Representational Only)

class Plan:
    def __init__(self, id, name, price, features):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.features = features
        
    def is_free(self):
        return self.price == 0
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} (${self.price}/month)"


class Subscription:
    def __init__(self, user, plan, start_date):
        self.user = user
        self.plan = plan
        self.start_date = start_date
        self.active = True
        
    def cancel(self):
        self.active = False
        
    def is_active(self):
        return self.active
        
    def days_remaining(self):
        # Calculate days remaining in subscription
        pass


class PaymentProcessor:
    @staticmethod
    def process_payment(card_details, amount):
        # Validate card
        if card_details.number.startswith('4') and len(card_details.number) == 16:
            return True
        return False


class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.subscription = None
        
    def subscribe(self, plan, payment_details):
        payment_successful = PaymentProcessor.process_payment(payment_details, plan.price)
        if payment_successful:
            self.subscription = Subscription(self, plan, datetime.now())
            return True
        return False
        
    def has_access_to_feature(self, feature_name):
        if not self.subscription or not self.subscription.is_active():
            return False
        return feature_name in self.subscription.plan.features


# Usage example
basic_plan = Plan("basic", "Basic Plan", 0, ["Track daily meals", "Basic food library"])
premium_plan = Plan("premium", "Premium Plan", 9.99, ["Unlimited meals", "Recipe suggestions"])

user = User("John Doe", "john@example.com")
card = CardDetails("John Doe", "4111111111111111", "12/25", "123")

if user.subscribe(premium_plan, card):
    print("Subscription successful!")
    
if user.has_access_to_feature("Recipe suggestions"):
    print("User can access recipe suggestions")
`}
